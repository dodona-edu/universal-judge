Write a function `echo`, which returns its argument.

In programming languages with a strong type system, you may assume the argument will always be a `string`. You can also assume this in other programming languages; an explicit check is not needed.

### Example

```pycon
>>> echo("5"); 
"5"
>>> echo("ok");
"ok"
```
