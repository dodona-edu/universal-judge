"""
The data types.

The data type system is used in two ways:

1. As a describing system: the types are used to denote the datatype of actual data.
2. As a prescribing system: the types are used to denote the channel type of some
   variable.

As mentioned in the manuscript, the context_testcase use is scenario 1.

Additionally, the types in this file are organized by their JSON encoding type.
They are also split in "basic types" and "advanced types".
