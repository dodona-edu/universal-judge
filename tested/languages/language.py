        Callback for generating the compilation command.

        Files
        -----

        The files parameter contains the dependencies which TESTed assumes can be
        useful for compilation. This generally includes the `dependencies` from the
        json config, the submission and either the context or the context and the
        selector. By convention, the last file in the list is the file containing
        the "main" function. The files are in the form of the filename, extension
        including.

        All files are guaranteed to be present in the same directory as the main
        file. You are not obligated to actually use all these files. In some
        languages, the compiler might find these dependencies on its own. Other
        compilers need all files.

        For example, the files parameter might look like this::

            ["values.py", "evaluation_utils.py", "context_0_0.py"]

        Compilation command
        -------------------

        The compilation command that is returned is a list of command parts, which
        will be passed to the `subprocess` module. The result of the compilation
        command must be an executable file (or files), that can be executed on the
        command line.

        Resulting files
        ---------------

        Additionally, TESTed needs to know which files are still relevant after
        compilation (to copy them to the execution folder). For example, in Python
        only *.pyc files are needed after compilation, not the *.py files.

        To this end, you can either return a static list of resulting files or a
        filter function:

        - The static list is useful if you know which files are generated. For
          example, in Python, each .py file will result in one .pyc file. In C,
          the result will be one executable.
        - The callback will be executed on all files in the directory after the
          compilation command has been executed. See below for more information.

        Note that the convention that the executable file is the last file in the
        list must be respected in the returned list as well.

        The callback function receives a filename as argument.

        Non-compiling languages
        -----------------------
        Languages that do not need compilation must return an empty list as
        compilation command, and can return the ``files`` unchanged. This is also
        the default implementation of this function.

        Parameters
        ----------

        :param files: A suggestion containing the dependencies TESTed thinks might
                      be useful to compile. By convention, the last file in the list
                      is the file containing the "main" function.
        :return: The compilation command and either the resulting files or a filter
                 for the resulting files.

        The returned command will be passed to the subprocess module.

        The ``cwd`` parameter is mainly useful for executables. Since those are not
        on the PATH, you should use an absolute path to those instead of a relative
        one.
